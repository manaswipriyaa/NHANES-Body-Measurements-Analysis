# NHANES-Body-Measurements-Analysis

Project Overview
----------------
This project is part of my Corizo Data Science Minor Project. 
It focuses on analysing NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) 
adult body measurement data using Python libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, 
Pandas, Seaborn, and SciPy.

The objective is to explore and compare male and female body measurements, 
compute health-related indicators like BMI, Waist-to-Height Ratio (WHtR), 
and Waist-to-Hip Ratio (WHR), and visualise statistical patterns.

---------------------------------------------------------
Project Objectives
---------------------------------------------------------
1. Import and clean NHANES male and female datasets.
2. Visualise weight distributions using histograms.
3. Compare male and female weights using boxplots.
4. Compute statistical aggregates (mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis).
5. Add Body Mass Index (BMI) as a new feature.
6. Standardise the female dataset using z-scores.
7. Perform correlation analysis (Pearson & Spearman) with scatterplot matrices.
8. Compute Waist-to-Height Ratio (WHtR) and Waist-to-Hip Ratio (WHR).
9. Compare BMI, WHtR, and WHR as health indicators.
